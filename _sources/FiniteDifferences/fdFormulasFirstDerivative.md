## First order formulas

Finite difference formulas are just finite difference approximations, disregarding the truncation error, e.g., from {eq}`eq:fdExpansion`, we have

$$
\frac{du}{dt}=\frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{\Delta t}+O(\Delta t).
$$ (eq:formulaForward)

Formula {eq}`eq:formulaForward` is called a *forward* difference formula because it uses the $u^n$ and the $u^{n+1}$ values, and it is a first order formula because the truncation error is of $O(\Delta t)$. The leading term of the truncation error is usually written with the formula to indicate its order of approximation.

We can use Taylor series expansions to obtain several lower order finite difference formulas. Using a backard Taylor series

$$
u(t-\Delta t)=u(t)-\Delta t\frac{du}{dt} + \frac{\Delta t^2}{2!}\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} - \frac{\Delta t^3}{3!}\frac{d^3u}{dt^3}+O(\Delta t^4),
$$ (eq:backwardExpansion)

and rearranging the terms, we obtain the *backward* difference formula for the 1st derivative:

$$
\frac{du}{dt}=\frac{u^{n}-u^{n-1}}{\Delta t} + O\left( \Delta t\right),
$$ (eq:formulaBackward)
 
which uses the $u^{n-1}$ and the $u^{n}$ values and is also a first order approximation.

By combining the forward and backward Taylor expansions, we obtain 

$$
\frac{du}{dt}=\frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n-1}}{2\Delta t} + O\left( \Delta t^2\right),
$$ (eq:formulaCentred)

which is called the *centred* difference formula and which is a second order approximation because its truncation error is proportional to $\Delta t^2$.

## Higher order formulas

The 1st and 2nd order formulas {eq}`eq:formulaForward`, {eq}`eq:formulaBackward`, {eq}`eq:formulaCentred` were obtained by manipulation of the Taylor series expansions of $u(t)$ but for higher order approximations, this soon becomes unpractical. However, there is a more expedite method to find higher order formulas. 

As the 2nd order formula needed more information about $u$ than the 1st order formulas, i.e. it needed more data points, we expect that higher order formulas will require even more data points. Let us consider the values of $u$ at $n-2$, $n-1$, $n$, $n+1$, $n+2$, and form an expression for the time derivative using the function values at these time steps:

$$
\left.\frac{du}{dt}\right|_{t^n} \approx a_{-2}u^{n-2}+a_{-1}u^{n-1}+a_{0}u^{n}+a_{1}u^{n+1}+a_{2}u^{n+2}, 
$$

where the $a_j$'s are coefficients to be determined. 

We start by expanding $u^{j}, \quad j=n-2,\dotsc,n+2$ as Taylor series of $u^n$, up to the fifth order term:

$$
\begin{align}
u^{n-2} &= u^n - 2\Delta t\frac{du}{dt}+4\frac{\Delta t^2}{2}\frac{d^2u}{dt^2}-8\frac{\Delta t^3}{6}\frac{d^3u}{dt^3}+16\frac{\Delta t^4}{24}\frac{d^4u}{dt^4}-32\frac{\Delta t^5}{120}\frac{d^5u}{dt^5} + O(\Delta t^6)\\

u^{n-1} &= u^n - \Delta t\frac{du}{dt}+\frac{\Delta t^2}{2}\frac{d^2u}{dt^2}-\frac{\Delta t^3}{6}\frac{d^3u}{dt^3}+\frac{\Delta t^4}{24}\frac{d^4u}{dt^4}-\frac{\Delta t^5}{120}\frac{d^5u}{dt^5} + O(\Delta t^6)\\

u^{n} &= u^n \\

u^{n+1} &= u^n + \Delta t\frac{du}{dt}+\frac{\Delta t^2}{2}\frac{d^2u}{dt^2}+\frac{\Delta t^3}{6}\frac{d^3u}{dt^3}+\frac{\Delta t^4}{24}\frac{d^4u}{dt^4}+\frac{\Delta t^5}{120}\frac{d^5u}{dt^5} + O(\Delta t^6)\\

u^{n+2} &= u^n + 2\Delta t\frac{du}{dt}+4\frac{\Delta t^2}{2}\frac{d^2u}{dt^2}+8\frac{\Delta t^3}{6}\frac{d^3u}{dt^3}+16\frac{\Delta t^4}{24}\frac{d^4u}{dt^4}+32\frac{\Delta t^5}{120}\frac{d^5u}{dt^5} + O(\Delta t^6).
\end{align}
$$

We now multiply the Taylor series expansions with the corresponding coefficient and group the terms per order of the derivative:

$$
\begin{align}
\left.\frac{du}{dt}\right|_{t^n} = &(a_{-2}+a_{-1}+a_{0}+a_{1}+a_{2})u^{n} + \\ 
   &(-2a_{-2}-a_{-1}+a_{1}+2a_{2})\Delta t\frac{du}{dt} + \\
   &(4a_{-2}+a_{-1}+a_{1}+4a_{2})\frac{\Delta t^2}{2}\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + \\
   &(-8a_{-2}-a_{-1}+a_{1}+8a_{2})\frac{\Delta t^3}{6}\frac{d^3u}{dt^3} + \\
   &(16a_{-2}+a_{-1}+a_{1}+16a_{2})\frac{\Delta t^4}{24}\frac{d^4u}{dt^4} + \\
   &(-32a_{-2}-a_{-1}+a_{1}+32a_{2})\frac{\Delta t^5}{120}\frac{d^5u}{dt^5} + O(\Delta t^6).
\end{align}
$$

In order for $\frac{du}{dt}\mid_{t^n}$ to converge to $du/dt$ when $\Delta t \to 0$, we must have:

$$
\begin{align}
\mathrm{c1:}& \quad a_{-2}+a_{-1}+a_{0}+a_{1}+a_{2} = 0 \\
\mathrm{c2:}& \quad (-2a_{-2}-a_{-1}+a_{1}+2a_{2})\Delta t = 1,
\end{align}
$$

which provides two necessary conditions, there remaining three parameters to choose in order to have the highest accuracy. This implies cancelling the next three truncation errors:

$$
\begin{align}
\mathrm{c3:}& \quad 4a_{-2}+a_{-1}+a_{1}+4a_{2} = 0 \\
\mathrm{c4:}& \quad -8a_{-2}-a_{-1}+a_{1}+8a_{2} = 0 \\
\mathrm{c5:}& \quad 16a_{-2}+a_{-1}+a_{1}+16a_{2} = 0.
\end{align}
$$

Conditions c1 to c5 provide five equations for five unknowns whose solution is:

$$
a_{-2}=\frac{1}{12\Delta t}, \quad a_{-1}=-\frac{8}{12\Delta t}, \quad a_{0}=0, \quad a_{1}=\frac{8}{12\Delta t}, \quad a_{2}=-\frac{1}{12\Delta t}.
$$ (eq:coefficients)

Our higher order approximation for the first derivative is therefore

$$
\left.\frac{du}{dt}\right|_{t^n} \approx \frac{u^{n-2}-8u^{n-1}+8u^{n+1}-u^{n+2}}{12\Delta t}. 
$$ (eq:higherOrderDuDt)

The leading term of the truncation error is

$$
(-32a_{-2}-a_{-1}+a_{1}+32a_{2})\frac{\Delta t^5}{120}\frac{d^5u}{dt^5},
$$

which, after substituting the values of the coefficients {eq}`eq:coefficients`, is

$$
-\frac{\Delta t^4}{30}\frac{d^5u}{dt^5}.
$$

Our approximation {eq}`eq:higherOrderDuDt` is, therefore, a 4th order approximation to the first derivative.

The method can be generalized to obtain the $p^{th}$ order approximation of the derivative using the functions values $u^{n-m},\dotsc,u^{n+m}$:

$$
\left.\frac{du}{dt}\right|_{t^n} \approx a_{-m}u^{n-m}+\dotsb+a_{0}u^{n}+\dotsb+a_{m}u^{n+m}, 
$$ (eq:generalApproximationDuDt)

To build the system of equations whose solution provides the unknown coefficients $a_{n-m},\dotsc,a_{n+m}$, we use the Taylor series expansion for each term $u^{n+q}, \quad q=-m,\dotsc,m$:

$$
u^{n+q} = u^n + q\Delta t\frac{du}{dt}+q^2\frac{\Delta t^2}{2}\frac{d^2u}{dt^2}+\dotsb+q^p\frac{\Delta t^p}{p!}\frac{d^pu}{dt^p}+O(\Delta t^{p+1})
$$

in {eq}`eq:generalApproximationDuDt` and group the terms according to the order of the derivative in which they appear. Then, we require that:

1. The sum of coefficients $a_q$ multiplying a derivative of order $k<p$ be zero;
2. The sum of coefficients $a_q$ multiplying the derivative of order $p$ be one.

We thus obtain a system of $p+1$ equations for the $2m+1$ coefficients $a_q$. Requirements 1 and 2 can only be satisfied if there are $2m+1>p+1$ points, i.e., we must have $2m>p$. 

If there are more points than needed, we used them to cancel the next few terms in the truncation error. We can use $2m+1$ points to cancel up to order $2m-p+1$.
