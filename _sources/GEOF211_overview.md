In this course you learn to use numerical methods to solve simple problems in fluid dynamics. We study exact and numerical solutions of partial differential equations linked to advection, diffusion, oscillation and wave processes, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of different numerical schemes.

You will learn to use methods to solve initial value problems and show how you can solve diagnostic boundary value problems with guessing and correction.
