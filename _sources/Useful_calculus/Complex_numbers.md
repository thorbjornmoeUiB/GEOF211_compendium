# Complex numbers

The imaginary unit, $i$ is defined as:
$$
i=\sqrt{-1}
$$ (eq:Complex_i)

A complex number is and expression of the form: 

$$
z=x+iy
$$ (eq:Complex_def)

The distance from origo, the the point (x,y) in the complex plane is called the modulus and is defined as:
$$
|z|=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}
$$ (eq:Complex_modulus)

The norm of a complex  number (equivalent of the vector length in the complex plane) is:
$$
|z|^2=x^2+y^2
$$ (eq:Complex_norm_squared)

The modulus of a product of two complex numbers $z$ and $w$ is:
$$
|zw|=|z||w|
$$ (eq:Complex_modulus_product)

The modulus of the sum of two complex numbers, also called "The triangle inequality" is defined:
$$
|z+w|<|z|+|w|
$$ (eq:Complex_triangle_identity)
